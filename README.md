# SDC(System Design Capstone) : Products API

## Overview

A backend server and database of product information for an e-commerce web app.
My goal was to replace an existing API with a back end system that can support the full data set for the project and to scale to meet the demands of production traffic.

After I designed a database(PostgreSQL) and the server, I also deployed to AWS EC2 and scaled the service to support at minimum 1k RPS(requests per second) on AWS EC2 using a t2.micro instance.

## Objectives
- Design and multiple database options to analyze and compare, selecting one db option. (I chose PostgreSQL)
- ETL Process (Extract the data from csv files, and Load them into the database after Transformating)
- Design and build an API server to provide data to the client in the format specified by the API doc.
- Optimize the server by analyzing query times and server responses.
- Deploy the service and improve the performance of you service at sacle.

## Phase Description

* Phase 0: Picking a project and initial setup
* Phase 1: Create the Database
* Phase 2: Create the API
* Phase 3: Performance Tune the Service
* Phase 4: Deploy and Benchmark Initial Performance
* Phase 5: Scale the Application

## Routes

| Request Type | Endpoint                      | Returns                                                                    
|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| GET          | /products                     | Retrieves the list of products                                 
| GET          | /products/:product_id         | Returns all product level information for a specified product id                                
| GET          | /products/:product_id/styles  | Returns the all styles available for the given product            
| GET          | /products/:product_id/related | Returns the id's of products related to the product specified     

## Testing
I used the <b>Artillery</b> for the local stress test and the <b>Loader.io</b> for the cloud-based load test.

### [Initial Stage : During 60sec] - Local
| API Service | Response Time/1 RPS | Median Response Time/100 RPS| ERROR Rate/100 RPS|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Test Type | Postman | Artillery | Artillery |
| List Products | 27ms | 5,711 ms | 98.4% |
| Product Information | 188ms | 6,064 ms | 98.6% |
| Product Styles | 53,568ms | N/A | 100% |
| Related Products | 607ms | 5,487 ms | 56.6% |

### [Mid Stage : During 60sec] - Local (*After optimization)
| API Service | Response Time/1 RPS | Median Response Time/100 RPS| ERROR Rate/100 RPS|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Test Type | Postman | Artillery | Artillery |
| List Products | 22 ms | 5 ms | 0% |
| Product Information | 25 ms | 5 ms | 0% |
| Product Styles | 28 ms | 8.9 ms | 0% |
| Related Products | 19 ms | 4 ms | 0% |

### [Final Stage : During 60sec] - AWS EC2 Instance/Loader.io

## Installation

- Navigate to the folder where it was cloned.
- With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed, 
```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```
-> This will install all necessary packages, and start the express server.
Open http://localhost:3000

## Usage

- You can test the api by sending curl commands or a service to send requests for you such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
- Alternatively, you could install one of the front end clients and direct it to this api in order to fully use it.
